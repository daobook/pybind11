"The :func:`PYBIND11_MODULE` macro creates a function that will be called "
"when an ``import`` statement is issued from within Python. The module "
"name (``example``) is given as the first macro argument (it should not be"
" in quotes). The second argument (``m``) defines a variable of type "
":class:`py::module_ <module>` which is the main interface for creating "
"bindings. The method :func:`module_::def` generates binding code that "
"exposes the ``add()`` function to Python."
msgstr ""

#: ../../basics.rst:126
msgid ""
"Notice how little code was needed to expose our function to Python: all "
"details regarding the function's parameters and return value were "
"automatically inferred using template metaprogramming. This overall "
"approach and the used syntax are borrowed from Boost.Python, though the "
"underlying implementation is very different."

"pybind11 is a header-only library, hence it is not necessary to link "

"If you used :ref:`include_as_a_submodule` to get the pybind11 source, "

"The `python_example`_ and `cmake_example`_ repositories are also a good "
"place to start. They are both complete project examples with cross-"

":class:`arg` is one of several special tag classes which can be used to "
